I stand by the principle that fashion is fun. There is no wrong or right way. Wear what you want. Rock it! Own it!  If you love it and I don’t, I will happily to agree to disagree as my own love for fashion hasn’t always been obvious and has often been eccentric.

 As a child I had a 1950’s phase; I listened to Elvis and asked my mom to sew me a poodle skirt. She did. Thanks Mom! 

After I read all the Little House on the Prairie books by Laura Ingalls Wilder, I tracked down a bonnet at the flea market and would even wear it out of the house. 

Like many pre-teens I had an all black phase because I felt awkward and black is supposed to be a fashion fix all (or hide all). 

I wore a tie-dye t-shirt with a grey cut-off hoodie on a date with my high-school boyfriend. He was pretty mortified to be seen with me.  To be fair I was really into the musical HAIR at that point in time. Nirvana and grunge was also popular then so there was nothing to say that tie-dye, cut-offs and the occasional flannel weren’t good looks. 

I’ve mixed and matched patterns, which has prompted others to ask if I am colorblind. I still wear bright yellow unapologetically.

 Even though I suffered some flack for my style, most of the people I grew up with didn’t care. I consider myself fortunate to have grown up in Oakland, and in my day, most of us didn’t come from well to do families. We dressed in second hand clothes and wore shoes from Pay-less. I cleaned houses for rich people so I had an early exposure to finery and high quality brands that were well beyond my means. I sure did envy those closets. My weight has often fluctuated due to self-esteem problems in my younger days and I usually felt hopelessly nerdy and fat, even if I really wasn't.  I secretly wished I could go to finishing school because it seemed to me southern belles had it made. I also wished I had an older sister to teach me to be “girly.” My definition of "girly" has changed since then. I would stress to anyone reading this the importance of loving yourself and accepting yourself as you are. Sure, it's great to want to be better, but be HEALTHY and love your flaws. 


After college I became friends with the receptionist at a very corporate company I worked at. As she was in a visible role, she had to dress impeccably and she was a naturally beautiful girl, slim, hair always blown out and make up done perfectly. She never made me feel dorky or fat and provided some of that big-sister guidance I was looking for.

AND she loved purses! They were the elegant statement pieces that tied her outfits together. It was her that first introduced me to the idea that a well-made high quality purse is an investment. After dabbling with cheaper mass market bags I came to realize she was right. These cheaper bags always broke: the zipper, the lining or the straps, something would fail after only a few months of use. 

Shopping for high quality second hand clothes is not an issue in the Bay Area. You might have to hunt, but on a good day you can find anything from cashmere to Armani tucked away at the Salvation Army or Goodwill, but handbags are more elusive. Used bags are often beat up, the lining stained and remnants of their former owners remain. Hair, skin flakes, gum wrappers, yuck! It grosses me out. 

Thank goodness for Ebay! I have been able to find used luxury bags for the same price of a new lesser quality brand bag. Some people like the thrill of the NEW and purchase these brands simply for the sake of buying, use them once or often not at all and the bags might linger in their closets for years. If you don’t care about what is in this season and chose bags with classic profiles you can buy beautiful pieces that will last you many years and cost anywhere from 75-90% of the original retail price. If I do buy a new bag it is usually to support small or local business (and on sale). 

Over the years I have carefully curated a collection of bags. The original intention of this blog was to explore this collection and the reason behind my choices.  (I have other passions besides purses and will surely write about those later.) Fendi is the most prominent brand in my collection, not intentionally, but typically I have found this brand to meet many of the requirements of what I look for in a bag: aesthetics, durability, functionality and comfort. My second favorite brand is August (http://augustca.com)– a small company based in Los Angeles whose bags are designed with travel in mind, thoughtfully made and for every bag purchased they donate to Operation School Bell (https://operationschoolbell.org ) which provides back-packs and clothing to kids in need. Any endorsement of a bag or product on this blog in unpaid and done so because it is a product I enjoy. I will strive to be honest and candid in my reviews. 

Let the fun begin!
